Oh joy has a risen the sun has come again to hold you. Sailing out the doldrums of the week. The polyphonic prayer is here it's all around you. It's all around you out here. And if the whole world is crashing down on you. Fall through out of space out of mind with me. Where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising blows all the shadows far away. The falling of the whole empire is here to hold you rolling out and haunted 'till it sleeps. Little memoriesmarching on your little feet working the machine will it spin? will it soar? my little dreams working the machine. Soon like a wave empires will fall. They're closing around you they're going on. Little memories, your little feet, working the machine will it spin? will it soar? my little dreams working the machine. Soon like a wave empires will fall. They're closing in around you. They're going on.
